# The Neurodiversity-Friendly Eisenhower Matrix üß†ü™Ñ

<br>

## What is the Eisenhower Matrix?

The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, is a decision-making tool designed to help prioritise tasks based on their urgency and importance. It was named after former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was known for his productivity and time management skills.

### Visualisation of the traditional Eisenhower Matrix

|                      | **Urgent**       | **Not Urgent**  |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Important**         | Tasks that should be done first         | Tasks that should be planned to be completed in the near future          |
| **Not Important**     | Tasks that can be delegated to others          | Tasks that are of low value and that you should avoid or eliminate        |

## Who uses it, and in what situations?

The Eisenhower Matrix can be used by anyone who needs help with task prioritisation. It can be used for prioritising work tasks, chores - pretty much any task that you want to include in there.

## Why can the traditional Eisenhower Matrix be difficult for Neurodivergent people to understand?

The traditional Eisenhower Matrix can be challenging for neurodivergent people (such as those with ADHD, autism, or other conditions) due to the way it frames task prioritization and decision-making. Neurodivergent individuals may think or process information differently, which can make rigid systems like the Eisenhower Matrix harder to use effectively. Here are some reasons why:

### 1. Difficulty with Time Perception and Urgency

ADHD and other neurodivergent conditions can impact how people perceive time. For example, someone with ADHD might struggle with time blindness, finding it difficult to estimate how long tasks will take or when deadlines are approaching.

The distinction between **Urgent** and **Not Urgent** can be unclear, as every task might feel equally pressing or, conversely, non-urgent until the last minute.

### 2. Executive Function Challenges

Executive dysfunction, which affects planning, organising, and task initiation, is common among neurodivergent people. This makes it difficult to prioritize tasks or even decide what falls into each quadrant of the matrix.

Breaking down tasks into **Important** vs. **Not Important** can feel overwhelming, leading to avoidance or procrastination rather than clear prioritisation.

### 3. All-or-Nothing Thinking

Some neurodivergent people may experience black-and-white thinking, where they struggle to categorise tasks on a spectrum of urgency or importance. A task might feel either extremely urgent or not important at all, making the middle ground harder to engage with.

### 4. Task Paralysis

Neurodivergent people can experience task paralysis, where knowing something is important but not feeling equipped to start it (due to overwhelm or lack of clarity) leads to inaction.

The pressure of identifying **Urgent and Important** tasks can make it harder to get started, especially if the task seems too big or complex to handle immediately.

### 5. Emotional Dysregulation and Interest-Based Motivation

Many neurodivergent people, especially those with ADHD, are more motivated by interest-based tasks rather than importance or urgency. The Eisenhower Matrix doesn‚Äôt take into account how interest, emotional engagement, or hyperfocus might drive task completion.

Tasks that are boring but urgent might feel impossible to approach, leading to a backlog of tasks in the **Urgent and Important** quadrant.

### 6. Unclear Delegation Boundaries

Some neurodivergent individuals might find it difficult to determine what tasks they can realistically delegate to others, due to issues with communication, trust, or social anxiety.

Delegation requires managing multiple people and tasks, which can be overwhelming.

### 7. Rigid Structure

The matrix is inherently rigid and linear, which may not fit the more nonlinear thinking styles common among neurodivergent people.

Some might feel boxed in by the strict categories, leading to frustration or avoidance.

## How can this Neurodiversity Friendly Matrix resolve these issues?

The Neurodiversity Friendly Matrix provides a more flexible, intuitive approach. Here is how this is done:

### 1. It uses an Interest-Energy approach rather than Urgent-Important

The words **Urgent** and **Important** are replaced with **Interest** and **Energy**.

Neurodivergent people often struggle to complete tasks based on importance or urgency alone, but they may find tasks easier to handle if aligned with their level of interest or energy.

### Basic visualisation of the Neurodiversity Friendly Matrix

|                      | **High Energy**       | **Low Energy**  |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **High Interest**         | Do Now         | Do in Downtime          |
| **Low Interest**     | Schedule/Plan          | Delegate or Break Down        |

### 2. Users can incorporate Time Estimates or Chunking

Time blindness can make it difficult to assess how long tasks will take. In the Neurodiversity Friendly Matrix, the user can add a time estimate next to each task, so they know whether it's a 5-minute task or a multi-hour project.

Chunking can break larger, overwhelming tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps.

### Example:

- **High Interest, High Energy (Do Now)**: "Write blog post (30 mins)"
- **Low Interest, Low Energy (Delegate/Break Down)**: "Do taxes (break into 10-min steps)"

### 3. Users can add colour coding and icons

Visual aids like colour coding and icons make the matrix more intuitive. The user can colour-code tasks based on how interesting or energy-consuming they are.

### Example:

- The use of **red** for low-interest tasks, **green** for high-interest, and symbols like **lightning bolts** or **battery icons** for energy levels.

### 4. Flexible Task Switching

The user can incorporate a task-switching system for when interest or focus shifts. Instead of feeling boxed into completing one task, they can list a few fallback tasks that are easier to shift to when they lose focus.

### Example:

If the user is working on a high-energy, low-interest task and they start feeling overwhelmed, they can switch to a low-energy, low-interest task that is still productive (e.g. organising files or cleaning).

### 5. Rewards for finishing difficult or boring tasks

Neurodivergent brains, especially ADHD, often need dopamine boosts to stay motivated.

Users can incorporate rewards into their matrix, where completing a **Low Interest** task unlocks a reward (like a short break or a fun activity).

### Example:

The user can assign a 10-minute break as a reward for finishing **Low Interest, High Energy** tasks, allowing them to enjoy something stimulating afterward.

### 6. Task Paralysis Safeguards

To avoid getting stuck in task paralysis, the user can add **Mini Tasks** to each main task. These are small actions that are easier to start. This helps with overcoming inertia when even simple things feel overwhelming.

### Example:

The user can break down a task like "Clean the kitchen" into very small parts: "Put away three dishes" and "Wipe down one counter". They can then add these Mini Tasks underneath the main task.
